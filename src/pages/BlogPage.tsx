      <h2>Introducing Localista: your neighborhood, explained</h2>
      <p className="byline">The Localista project · 2026</p>

      <p>
        Quick quiz: you can probably name the President. Maybe your governor, and one
        of your U.S. senators. But who represents you on your city or state level —
        and if you live in Washington, DC, who is your ANC commissioner, the elected
        neighbor whose job is literally to represent your few blocks? When is that
        seat next on the ballot? What is your city council actually voting on this
        month?
      </p>
      <p>
        For most of us the honest answer is “no idea” — not from apathy, but because
        the information is scattered across a dozen government sites, each organized
        by agency rather than by <em>you</em>. The paradox of local government is
        that the offices with the most direct effect on daily life are the hardest to
        see.
      </p>

      <h3>What Localista is</h3>
      <p>
        Localista is a free website and installable app that starts from one input —
        where you are — and assembles your complete civic picture: every jurisdiction
        you live in, every representative you’re eligible to elect (federal, state,
        and hyperlocal), their terms, contact details and next elections, current
        bills under consideration, upcoming election dates, and Census facts about
        your state, county, and city. Every item is labeled with its official data
        source.
      </p>

      <h3>Who it’s for</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Residents</strong> who want to know who speaks for them before
          signing a petition, attending a meeting, or casting a ballot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>New arrivals</strong> — moved recently? One address lookup rebuilds
          your entire civic map.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Organizers and advocates</strong> who need the right office (and
          its phone number) on the first try.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Journalists, researchers, and civics teachers</strong> who need a
          fast, sourced answer to “who represents this address?”
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why we built it</h3>
      <p>
        Three reasons. First, the gap is real: hyperlocal offices like DC’s Advisory
        Neighborhood Commissions publish their data in GIS systems most people will
        never open. Second, the tools that used to help are disappearing — Google
        retired its Civic Information representatives API in 2025, leaving many
        “find your rep” sites broken. Third, we think the answer should be
        infrastructure, not a product: Localista is open source, keyless to use, and
        built almost entirely on open government data compiled into static files —
        there’s no server watching what you look up, and your location never leaves
        your device except to query public geocoders. (More in{' '}
        <a href="#/about">About</a> and the <a href="#/faq">FAQ</a>.)
